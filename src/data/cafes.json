There’s also a spacious terrace.\nWhat I loved most was the menu: they focus on healthier options and use homemade products like butter, jam, and granola. You’ll find breakfast and brunch menus, as well as lunch dishes like bagels, toasts, and burgers.\nA personal highlight: two little tables by the window. I sat there working while watching the rain outside — the perfect cozy spot. They’re very laptop-friendly — in fact, they mentioned the second floor is often seen as their co-working area."

There's a small terrace out front with three tables, perfect for a sunny day. The interior is not very big either but it is cozy and there are two window tables which are always my go-to spot when I’m alone."
