    "review": "The space is huge — it has two floors, and a third one was under renovation when I visited.There’s also a spacious terrace.\nBesides having lots of space, I also loved their menu: they focus on healthier options and use homemade products like butter, jam, and granola.\nYou’ll find breakfast and brunch menus, as well as lunch dishes like bagels, toasts, and burgers.\nA personal highlight: two little tables by the window. I sat there working while watching the rain outside — the perfect cozy spot.\nThey’re very laptop-friendly — in fact, they mentioned the second floor is often seen as their co-working area."
